# Sugar and Charm 
### Beetroot Dip

If you think you don't like beets, you haven't had them like this! The vibrant color alone makes you want dive in with a delicious piece of toasted pita. I know I don't share a lot of savory recipes, but I'm going to start sharing some of my favorite party recipes that are great for entertaining! This dip is made with roasted beets, yogurt, olive oil and lots of garlic. It's topped with hazelnuts, feta and some green onions. The lively shade of dark pink color will entice the worst of the worst beet haters! I think I'm going to serve this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.
