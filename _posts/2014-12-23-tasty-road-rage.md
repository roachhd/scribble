- 100g milk chocolate, melted

{% endhighlight %}


###### Method
{% highlight ruby %}
- Set out a tray or serving plate for the Teddies.
- Sort the Smarties into colours and cut 12 Smarties in half with a sharp knife to use for steering wheels (keep in mind steering wheel colours need to match with wheel colours).
- Remove the wrappers from the Milky Way bars.
- Cut 24 Tiny Teddies in half at the belly button using a sharp knife.
- Place the melted chocolate into a resealable bag and snip a tiny corner off. Squeeze out a few drops of chocolate to glue 4 Smarties 'wheels' on each car then place on the serving tray.
- Place a few drops of chocolate on the top of each 'car' and sit the Teddies on. Place a drop of chocolate on the 'car' in the front of each Teddy and glue on steering wheels.
