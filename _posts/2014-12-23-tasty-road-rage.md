# Tiny Teddy Racers


#### Ingredients
{% highlight ruby %}
- 100g cooking chocolate, melted
- 1 bag Milky Way bars
- 1 box Tiny Teddy biscuits, honey flavour
- 1 bag Smarties (340g)
{% endhighlight %}


#### Method
{% highlight ruby %}
Prep: 
 Set out a tray or serving plate for the Teddies.
 Sort the Smarties into colours 
 Cut 12 Smarties in half with a sharp knife to use for steering wheels.
Remove the wrappers from the Milky Way bars.
Cut 24 Tiny Teddies in half at the belly button using a sharp knife.

Place the melted chocolate into a resealable bag and snip a tiny corner off. Squeeze out a few drops of chocolate to glue 4 Smarties 'wheels' on each car then place on the serving tray.
Place a few drops of chocolate on the top of each 'car' and sit the Teddies on. 
Place a drop of chocolate on the 'car' in the front of each Teddy and glue on steering wheels.
{% endhighlight %}

**Notes**: Try and keep the car wheels and steering weeks the same color for extra style. 
Also you don't have to cut the tiny teddies if you place a small slit in the milkways.
Milkyways can be substituted for just about and fun size bar.
